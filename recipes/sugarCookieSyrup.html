    <p>This holiday syrup is perfect in your cup of coffee because, for some reason, it is unacceptable to eat cookies all day.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon butter extract</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon almond extract</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Put water and sugar in a medium saucepan and bring mixture to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, lower heat and let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, until sugar is completely dissolved and mixture has thickened a bit.</li>
            <li>Remove saucepan from heat and add vanilla, butter, and almond extracts and stir.</li>
            <li>Pour syrup into a mason jar or bowl and place in fridge to cool completely before using. Syrup will continue to thicken as it cools.</li>
